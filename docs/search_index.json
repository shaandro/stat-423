In this data, each subject was given both drug 1 and drug 2, and the change in their sleep was measured. The column group indicates which drug the subject took, and the column extra indicates the change in sleep. data(&quot;sleep&quot;) # X: effect on sleep from drug 1 x &lt;- sleep$extra[sleep$group == 1] # Y: effect on sleep from drug 2 y &lt;- sleep$extra[sleep$group == 2] # Z: paired difference between X and Y z &lt;- y - x For each of these tests, we will be testing the hypotheses \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu = 0\\) vs \\(H_a\\): \\(\\mu \\neq 0\\), where \\(\\mu\\) is the mean of \\(Z\\). 1.1 Paired \\(t\\)-test Parametric test One-sample \\(t\\)-test on the mean \\(\\mu\\) of \\(Z\\) Assumption: \\(Z_i \\overset{\\mathrm{iid}} \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) Hypotheses: \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu = \\mu_0\\) vs \\(H_a\\): \\(\\mu \\neq \\mu_0\\) (or \\(&lt;\\), \\(&gt;\\)) Test statistic: \\[T_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{\\bar{Z} - \\mu_0}{s_Z / \\sqrt{n}},\\] where \\(\\bar{Z}\\) and \\(s_Z\\) are the sample mean and sample standard deviation of \\(Z\\) Null distribution: Under \\(H_0\\), \\(T_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\sim t_{n-1}\\) There are three ways to do this test in R using the function t.test. If the observations for group \\(X\\) and group \\(Y\\) are stored in separate vectors x and y, then we use t.test with the argument paired = TRUE. t.test(x, y, paired = TRUE, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: x and y ## t = -4.0621, df = 9, p-value = 0.002833 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2.4598858 -0.7001142 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -1.58 If the paired differences \\(Z = Y - X\\) are stored in one vector z, then we use a one-sample t.test. t.test(z, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) ## ## One Sample t-test ## ## data: z ## t = 4.0621, df = 9, p-value = 0.002833 ## alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.7001142 2.4598858 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x ## 1.58 If the data is stored in one matrix or dataframe where one column contains the observations and another column contains the groups, we can use the following syntax. For this data, extra contains the observations, and group indicates which group each observation comes from. t.test(extra ~ group, paired = TRUE, data = sleep, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) ## ## Paired t-test ## ## data: extra by group ## t = -4.0621, df = 9, p-value = 0.002833 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -2.4598858 -0.7001142 ## sample estimates: ## mean of the differences ## -1.58 The result for all three values is the same: \\(p\\text{-value} = 0.002833\\). 1.2 Sign test Also called binomial test Nonparametric test on the median \\(\\theta\\) of \\(Z\\) Assumption: \\(Z_i\\) are iid Hypotheses: \\(H_0\\): \\(\\theta = \\theta_0\\) vs \\(H_a\\): \\(\\theta \\neq \\theta_0\\) (or \\(&lt;\\), \\(&gt;\\)) Test statistic: \\[X = I\\{Z_i &gt; \\theta_0\\},\\] where \\(I\\{Z_i &gt; \\theta_0\\}\\) is the number of observations \\(Z_i\\) that are greater than \\(\\theta_0\\). Null distribution: Under \\(H_0\\), \\(X \\sim \\mathrm{Binom}(n, p = 0.5)\\) The alternative hypothesis \\(H_a\\): \\(\\theta &lt; 0\\) is equivalent to \\(H_a\\): \\(p &lt; 0.5\\), where \\(p = P(Z_i &gt; 0)\\). This is because, under \\(H_0\\): \\(\\theta = 0\\), the probability of \\(Z_i\\) being less than the median \\(\\theta\\) is 0.5. The test is conducted as follows. # calculate paired differences z &lt;- y - x # calculate the number of observations greater than 0 X &lt;- sum(z &gt; 0) # calculate p-value 2 * min(pbinom(X, size = length(z), prob = 0.5), 1 - pbinom(X, size = length(z), prob = 0.5)) ## [1] 0.001953125 1.3 Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test Nonparametric test on the median \\(\\theta\\) of \\(Z\\) Assumptions: \\(Z_i\\) are iid and symmetric Hypotheses: \\(H_0\\): \\(\\theta = \\theta_0\\) vs \\(H_a\\): \\(\\theta \\neq \\theta_0\\) (or \\(&lt;\\), \\(&gt;\\)) Test statistic: \\[V = \\sum_{i = 1}^n I\\{Z_i &gt; \\theta_0\\} \\mathrm{rank}(|Z_i - \\theta_0|)\\] Like with the paired \\(t\\)-test, there are three ways to conduct the Wilcoxon test using wilcox.test. wilcox.test(x, y, paired = TRUE, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(x, y, paired = TRUE, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;): ## cannot compute exact p-value with ties ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(x, y, paired = TRUE, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;): ## cannot compute exact p-value with zeroes ## ## Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction ## ## data: x and y ## V = 0, p-value = 0.009091 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 wilcox.test(z, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(z, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;): cannot compute ## exact p-value with ties ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(z, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;): cannot compute ## exact p-value with zeroes ## ## Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction ## ## data: z ## V = 45, p-value = 0.009091 ## alternative hypothesis: true location is not equal to 0 wilcox.test(extra ~ group, paired = TRUE, data = sleep, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(x = c(0.7, -1.6, -0.2, -1.2, -0.1, 3.4, 3.7, : ## cannot compute exact p-value with ties ## Warning in wilcox.test.default(x = c(0.7, -1.6, -0.2, -1.2, -0.1, 3.4, 3.7, : ## cannot compute exact p-value with zeroes ## ## Wilcoxon signed rank test with continuity correction ## ## data: extra by group ## V = 0, p-value = 0.009091 ## alternative hypothesis: true location shift is not equal to 0 Using all three methods, \\(p\\text{-value} = 0.009091\\). 1.4 Permutation Test Paired data \\((X_i, Y_i)\\), where \\(X_i\\) and \\(Y_i\\) are correlated Assumption: \\((X_1, Y_1), \\dots, (X_n, Y_n)\\) are iid For \\(n\\) subjects, there are \\(R = 2^n\\) equally likely permutation outcomes For each possible outcome \\(\\ell \\in \\{1, \\dots, R\\}\\), we calculate the sample mean of differences \\[z_\\ell = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^n (Y_{\\ell i} - X_{\\ell i}),\\] where \\((X_{\\ell i}, Y_{\\ell i})\\) is the \\(i\\)th observation of the \\(\\ell\\)th permutation outcome. The \\(p\\)-value depends on the direction of \\(H_a\\). \\(H_a\\) \\(p\\)-value \\(\\mu &gt; 0\\) \\(I\\{z_\\ell \\geq \\bar{Z}\\} / R\\) \\(\\mu &lt; 0\\) \\(I\\{z_\\ell \\leq \\bar{Z}\\} / R\\) \\(\\mu \\neq 0\\) \\(I\\{|z_\\ell| \\geq |\\bar{Z}|\\} / R\\) 1.4.1 Exact permutation test The exact permutation test for \\(H_a\\): \\(\\mu \\neq 0\\) is performed as follows. # paired differences z &lt;- y - x # sample size n &lt;- length(z) # create permutation matrix lists &lt;- split(matrix(c(-1, 1), n, 2, byrow=TRUE), 1:n) all.outcomes &lt;- as.matrix(expand.grid(lists)) # observed test statistic zbar &lt;- mean(z) # test statistic for permutation samples zl &lt;- apply(all.outcomes, 1, function(u) mean(u*abs(z))) # p-value mean(abs(zl) &gt;= abs(zbar)) ## [1] 0.00390625 In this example, we used the sample mean as our test statistic, but the choice of test statistic for the permutation test is flexible. 1.4.2 Large-sample approximation for permutation test Instead of using all \\(R = 2^n\\) possible permutation outcomes, we can randomly select \\(R\\) permutation outcomes and calculate the approximate \\(p\\)-value.

For this example, we will use the dataset chickwts. The column feed indicates the feed chicks were fed, and the column weight indicates the weight of the chick. We will only consider the weights of the feeds horsebean and linseed. data(&quot;chickwts&quot;) # subset only horsebean and linseed chickwts &lt;- subset(chickwts, feed == &quot;horsebean&quot; | feed == &quot;linseed&quot;) # X: weights of chicks with horsebean feed x &lt;- chickwts$weight[chickwts$feed == &quot;horsebean&quot;] # Y: weights of chicks with linseed feed y &lt;- chickwts$weight[chickwts$feed == &quot;linseed&quot;] For each test, we will be testing \\(H_a\\): \\(\\Delta \\neq \\Delta_0\\), where \\(\\Delta\\) is the difference in center (mean or median) between the two groups. 2.1 Two-Sample \\(t\\)-Test Parametric test Assumptions: \\(X_i \\overset{\\mathrm{iid}} \\sim N(\\mu_X, \\sigma^2)\\), \\(Y_i \\overset{\\mathrm{iid}} \\sim N(\\mu_Y, \\sigma^2)\\) Parameter of interest: \\(\\mu = \\mu_X - \\mu_Y\\) Hypotheses: \\(H_0\\): \\(\\mu = \\mu_0\\) vs \\(H_a\\): \\(\\mu \\neq \\mu_0\\) (or \\(&lt;\\), \\(&gt;\\)) Test statistic: \\[T_{\\mathrm{obs}} = \\frac{\\bar{X} - \\bar{Y} - \\mu_0}{s_p \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{m} + \\frac{1}{n}}}, \\quad \\text{where} \\quad s_p = \\frac{(m-1)s_X^2 + (n-1)s_Y^2}{m + n - 2}\\] Null distribution: Under \\(H_0\\), \\(T_{\\mathrm{obs}} \\sim t_{m + n - 2}\\) There are two ways to conduct this test using t.test. For both ways, we use the argument var.equal = TRUE and we let the argument mu be equal to \\(\\mu_0\\). If your two samples are in separate vectors x and y, you perform the test the way youre probably used to. t.test(x, y, mu = 0, var.equal = TRUE, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: x and y ## t = -2.934, df = 20, p-value = 0.008205 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -100.17618 -16.92382 ## sample estimates: ## mean of x mean of y ## 160.20 218.75 If your response variable is in one column of a dataset and the groups are indicated in a different column, we can use ~ and the argument data like we did for the paired \\(t\\)-test. t.test(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts, mu = 0, var.equal = TRUE, alternative = &quot;two.sided&quot;) ## ## Two Sample t-test ## ## data: weight by feed ## t = -2.934, df = 20, p-value = 0.008205 ## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## -100.17618 -16.92382 ## sample estimates: ## mean in group horsebean mean in group linseed ## 160.20 218.75 Using both methods, we get \\(p\\text{-value} = 0.008205\\). 2.2 Permutation Test Nonparametric tests Assumptions \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are independent \\(X_1, \\dots, X_m\\) are iid \\(Y_1, \\dots, Y_n\\) are iid Parameters of interest \\(\\Delta_1 = E(X_i) - E(Y_i)\\) \\(\\Delta_2 = \\mathrm{median}(X_i) - \\mathrm{median}(Y_i)\\) Hypotheses: \\(H_0\\): \\(\\Delta = \\Delta_0\\) vs \\(H_a\\): \\(\\Delta \\neq \\Delta_0\\) (or \\(&lt;\\), \\(&gt;\\)) Test statistic: \\(\\hat{\\Delta}_1 = \\bar{X} - \\bar{Y}\\) \\(\\hat{\\Delta}_2 = \\mathrm{median}(X) - \\mathrm{median}(Y)\\) For the remainder of this section, we will use \\(\\Delta\\) to represent the parameter of interest (difference in population means or medians) and \\(\\hat{\\Delta}\\) to represent the corresponding test statistic, since the permutation test works the same way regardless of the choice of test statistic. The total number of permutation outcomes is \\(R = {{m + n} \\choose {n}}\\). For each possible outcome \\(\\ell \\in \\{1, \\dots, R\\}\\), we calculate the sample test statistic (mean or median) \\(\\delta_\\ell\\). The \\(p\\)-value depends on the direction of \\(H_a\\). \\(H_a\\) \\(p\\)-value \\(\\Delta &gt; 0\\) \\(I\\{\\delta_\\ell \\geq \\hat{\\Delta}\\} / R\\) \\(\\Delta &lt; 0\\) \\(I\\{\\delta_\\ell \\leq \\hat{\\Delta}\\} / R\\) \\(\\Delta \\neq 0\\) \\(I\\{|\\delta_\\ell| \\geq |\\hat{\\Delta}|\\} / R\\) 2.2.1 Exact permutation test The exact permutation test for \\(H_a\\): \\(\\Delta \\neq 0\\), where \\(\\Delta\\) is the difference in population means, is carried out as follows. (You can also do this for medians by replacing mean with median in the code.) # append x and y xy &lt;- c(x, y) m &lt;- length(x) # sample size of x n &lt;- length(y) # sample size of y # construct permutation matrix permut &lt;- combn(m + n, n) # observed difference in sample means Delta &lt;- mean(x) - mean(y) # sample mean for each permutation outcome delta &lt;- apply(permut, 2, function(u) mean(xy[-u]) - mean(xy[u])) # p-value mean(abs(delta) &gt;= abs(Delta)) ## [1] 0.009229161 This code takes a while to run because there are so many permutation outcomes. Because of that, we can perform a large-sample approximation using fewer permutation outcomes. 2.2.2 Large-sample approximation for permutation test Instead of using all \\(R = {{m + n} \\choose {n}}\\) possible permutation outcomes, we can randomly select \\(R\\) permutation outcomes and calculate the approximate \\(p\\)-value.

Dr. Su refers to this as a large-sample approximation because, with a large enough sample, we can assume that the data is distributed normally. The sleep data shows the effect of two drugs on 10 patients. The dataset has three columns: extra (increase in hours of sleep), group (drug given), and ID (patient ID). The data is paired, since each patient was given both drug 1 and drug 2. k-sample.pdf, slide 9 "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
